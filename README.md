# hello-world
This is a simple exercise marking the start of learning something new.

Hello! My name is Alyssa, and I'm studying computer science.

I've always wanted to learn how to use GitHub for my projects, so I decided there's no better time than the present. 
I'm going to try to use GitHub regularly over the next month to learn how to use it. 
Hopefully I will continue to use GitHub even after the month is up. 

Wish me luck!
